# Autofill4JobApply
### How to setup
Close the project. Go to chrome://extensions/ and toggle on developer mode (top right corner). Next click "Load unpacked" and select the "Extension" folder in the github repo. Now the extension should be up and running! 

You then need to go into the terminal and run `node index.js` to start the dashboard link.

To access the dashboard and the autofill simply just click on the plugin.

### TODO
☑ Set up an extension.

☑ Read the contents of the page. 

☑ Get all of the form values that need to be filled out. 

☑ Figure out what the question is for that input.
- Create the website that allows the user to input their personal information.
- Fill out feilds based on user information.
- Create a developer dashboard that notifies any feilds that were not able to be filled out as well as where they are located.
